# 1.0.1
# Bug Fix
# 	Fixed the error that happens when you try to use the included functions before
#		starting a new save file, now the code should be self correcting, and the user
#		will need no special input.
# Please make sure not to overwrite the functions self.setupFamousPeople and self.setupFameInfo
#	when copying everything over, as they will be over-written if you dont.
