# 2.1.0																														#
# Bug Fix																													#
#	Small inconcequential bug fix that wouldn't hav affected anybody in the long run within the save parity system.			#
#		Basically, because of how Ruby handles passing variables, it just created a reference to one of the variables		#
#		which basically meant that the changes that were made to the parity part also changed the compiled data.			#
#		The reason why it didn't effect anything is because the compiled data is compiled prior to runtime,					#
#		since the data in the save parity system gets saved when the program closes, it further doesn't do anything.		#
# Compiler Update																											#
#	Added a few new guards in the compiler to make sure that the compiled data is properly intended.						#
#	Created a new system for printing the compiled data to the fame_targets.txt file. This ties into the other feature		#
# Debug Menu																												#
#	Added the ability to add, Modify, or Remove fame targets and fame info within the debug menu. This ended up taking 		#
#	longer than I expected because of how involved the debug menu functions were. 											#
#	that being said it should work without any issues.																		#
# Other Misc Things																											#
#	Did a bit of small quality of life things in the background, the end user probably won't need to worry about it.		#
#	Mainly, as part of the compiler update, I separated out the compile code to make it much easier to understand.			#
#===========================================================================================================================#
# 2.0.4																														#
# Bug Fix																													#
#	As it turns out, I had a hidden bug within the save parity system, that meant that save data for the plugin could break	#
#		in it's entirety. Basically, if you added an element or removed an element from any point that wasn't the last 		#
#		element it would cause the save file to desync. this also happened if you swapped the locations						#
#		of two pieces of information. I have now fixed that bug, however, if a save file 									#
#		was already broken prior to this release, there is nothing I can do to fix it because I had to implement 			#
#		a new element to the save file to ensure this doesn't happen in the future, and it is filled based on				#
#		the most recent compile and the last processed data. That being said, if you have only 								#
#		removed or added elements on the end of a famous person, didn't do both adding and removing, nor swapped 			#
#		any elements around, you shouldn't have any issues.																	#
#	Fixed a small bug where the first element would animate when still selecting a famous person							#
# Limitation																												#
#	Because of this implementation, if change the [] part of an element, it will be reset to it's default value,			#
#	as the key no longer exists. If you want to change the name of an element, you might want to change it in the PBS file	#
# Update																													#
#	Added the ability to modify the display name of famous people. Keep in mind that if the name was modified, it will		#
#		continue to be that name as it is saved to the save file. There are also included functions to get the display name	#
#		as well as remove the display name.																					#
#	Added the ability to put the item into the favorites menu. If you plan on using the actual item,						#
#		then this will enable your players to favorite it if they want.														#
#	Slightly changed the other user functions so that Strings(which convert to Symbols) can be used							#
#===========================================================================================================================#
# 2.0.3																														#
# Bug Fix																													#
#	While not exactly a bug, I modified how the code loads the compiled data as to remove the error message on first launch	#
# Update																													#
#	Added a variable within userFunctions.rb so that you can change the folder of the PBS file								#
#		Small updates to the compiler to account for this																	#
#===========================================================================================================================#
# 2.0.2																														#
# Bug Fix																													#
#	Yet another important bug to fix was found. The Save parity was broken because I wanted to limit updating				#
#		to reduce processing time, however doing that means that the save parity would never update when a player			#
#		launches the game, basically the save parity only updated when compiled, which doesn't help in the end				#
#		so I removed the extra guards, meaning it will run at least once per launch, keep in mind this might result in		#
#		slight lag if you have a ton of data																				#
#===========================================================================================================================#
# 2.0.1																														#
# Bug Fix																													#
#	Fixed an issue where old saves would crash every time the program was used due to the save file not existing			#
#		Due to the nature of it being a somewhat critical error, I pushed this as an update without any other modifications	#
#===========================================================================================================================#
# 2.0.0																														#
# Rewrite																													#
#   I've done a complete rewrite of the plugin, which includes seperating everything out into their respective classes      #
#	fixes up a lot of the jankiness of the original, and further cleaned up the code bloat.									#
#	Additionally, cleaning up the code will make it much easier moving foward to make bug fixes and add new features		#
#	Since I updated the save system, I have also added a conversion system so that previous versions don't cause issues		#
#		Conversion of bits of info is done solely by position, so ensure that all bits of info are in the same positions	#
# Update																													#
#	Lots of updates in this version																							#
#	The Info Sprites are now able to be animated																			#
#		In addition to that, I made it so that you can grab files from anywhere rather than the specific location			#
#		This is also true for the Device Sprites																			#
#	A lot of the user functions have been renamed to better reflect what they are intended to do							#
#	A new game switch was added to track the completion of all of the info within the FameChecker, default number is 2765	#
#		If you want to swap the number please just do so at the top of the userFunctions.rb file							#
#		the way to access it is FameChecker.FAME_SWITCH																		#
#	The biggest update is the introduction of PBS compiling. 																#
#		This was a majority of my efforts when I was creating the updates. I have tested it thouroughly						#
#		however, please take care to format everything as it is shown, as I may have missed something. If I did				#
#		and you have found it, I would love to know.																		#
#		All of the info for it is on the Github, which is linked above, or within the PBS file itself						#
# User guide will be on Github, or within the included readme.md file. You should be able to open it like a txt document	#

#   Updated everything to work with v20 and v20.1. I do still intend to support v19 and v19.1 for the time being            #
#   I will stop supporting versions as it reaches 3 versions behind, so v19 will stop being supported when v22 releases     #

#   Fixed an error which causes the game to hang if you remove the starter file "OAK.png" and attempt to press select.      #
#   This is due to a mistakenly hardcoded setup function which required "OAK.png" to be present. You are now free to remove #
#   all default small and big sprite files.                                                                                 #
